                        Dubai and its roots reach back through many time periods with a few big milestones such as 
                        welcoming the expatriates, the Al Maktoum dynasty, the Walled City, the Bani Yas tribe and finally the start 
                        all the way back in Early Minoan time period (3000BCE).
                        
                        The Minoan period was when Dubai is believed to have first been settled. The settling was done by cattle herders.
                        Within the first 500 years Dubai had a date palm plantation that was the first time the area had been used for 
                        agrucultural purposes.

                        The first actual mention of Dubai occured within a geogrpahy book written by Abu Abdullah Al Bakhri. Another early 
                        mention of Dubai was in a journal owned by a Venetian pearl merchant Gaspero Balbi. Around that time in Dubai, people were
                        making a living a few ways. Some of these ways include boat building and fishing.

                        The next big milestone in Dubai's history was in 1793, in that year the Bani Yas tribe settled with political power in 
                        Abu Dhabi. Dubai became dependant after this happened.

                        Early on in the 1800's Dubai was a walled city. They essentially walled off starting from a fort all the way around and 
                        reconnecting to the fort. Though this was not good for business that problem would be resolved in 1820 when Britain and Dubai 
                        came to a truce so that local trade routes would be opened up. This also turned Dubai into a trading center of sorts and a place
                        in which a lot of crucial activity took place.
